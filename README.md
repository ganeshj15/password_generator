# password_generator
Generates a strong password for you 

Having a weak password is not good for a system that demands high confidentiality and security of user credentials. It turns out that people find it difficult to make up a strong password that is strong enough to prevent unauthorized users from memorizing it.

So here we will make a small app using python which will generate a strong password with a length from 8 to 25 charecters.
In this we have taken the help of random module for genertaing the random charecters, pyperclip module to enable user to copied password to clipboard & then paste it.
Last but not the least tkinter for preparing the GUI.So ensure these packages are with you while running the code.

Final view of app will be as follows.
